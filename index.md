The purpose of this webpage is multifaceted.  Below are a few reasons:

* I tend to engage deeply with a project for a few weeks, and then shift focus to other things for a few months.  When I come back to the original project, I find I don't remember many of the solutions I had come up with or resources I've discovered, and have to spend time getting myself up to speed again.

* The same applies to topics of interest that I research.  I occasionally do a deep dive into a topic of interest, say, different battery chemistries, and have a deep understanding of the topic... for about a day.  If I spend a little time documenting my learnings and the resources that enabled that comprehension, it will allow me to refresh my understanding much more quickly.  This is the function of the "Wiki" section of the site.

* For the previous two points, I've tried to keep a notebook or Google Doc with relevant information in it.  

Notebooks clutter, are hard to organize with multiple projects, can't hyperlink or post picutres.  Can't share with other people very easily.

Google docs are terrible at linking to eachother, unaesthetic.

Notebooks are good for sketching, but I can still scan and upload.
