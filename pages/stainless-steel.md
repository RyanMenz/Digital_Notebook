# Stainless Steel Grades

## Stainless Steel
Stainless steel is an iron alloy composed primarily of iron and chromium.  The chromium in the material reacts with oxygen on the surface to create an oxidized “passive layer”, which prevents corrosion and rust. While all stainless steels have at least 10.5% chromium content, alloys with higher percentages demonstrate greater corrosion resistance. 

Stainless steel is often alloyed with other elements, such as nickel, carbon, silicon, manganese, and molybdenum, to enhance certain material characteristics. Manufacturers leverage this ability to increase the material’s formability, heat resistance, and durability, depending on the needs of the final product.
### 303
303 stainless steel has sulfur and phosphorus content which makes it highly machineable.
### 304/304L
The L in 304L stands for "Low Carbon".
### 316/316L
