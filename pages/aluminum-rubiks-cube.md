# Aluminum Rubik's Cube
The goal of this project is to create an entirely metal, fully functioning Rubik's Cube.  The only pieces that will not be machined from aluminum are the tensioning springs.  Each face of the cube will be anodized a different color.  Aside from the design and manufacture, the anodizing will be a primary challenge of this project.
